# qiss
qiss is short and sweet

## What

qiss is a byte-code interpreter. It has the same high-level parts that most byte-code interpreters (e.g., Python, Ruby, Lua..) do:

Lexer -> Parser -> Compiler -> Code Generator -> Virtual Machine
----------------------------------------------------------------
Runtime: Memory, I/O, built-in functions & data structures

The qiss language is a variant of k.

## Why

My goal for qiss is to have fun learning.
